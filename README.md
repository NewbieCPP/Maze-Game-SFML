# Maze-Game-SFML

Video Preview for the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPeeFX-wPTQ

The game is about a player (You) who is trying to pass a maze before the time runs out.

Be careful! As there are enemies that are trying to hunt you down to death.

You can try to collect as much coins as possible to increase your score. But don't be so careless as your time might run out.



# Information about the development of the game

This is a simple tile-based maze game created using SFML, an external C++ Library.

The game is still in it's basic form. It's also poorly designed since i didn't know any design concepts when i was creating it.

This game was a way for me to implement what i learned in the very beginning of my Object Oriented Programming journey, excluding any code design of course (since i didn't have that knowledge yet).

Make sure to check out the rest of the game files: https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqV736O9akOdg58HhFZXkG9mVaMLFA .These files are essential for the game to work as it should.
